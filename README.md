Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

(Key Milestones in the Evolution of Software Engineering
The Birth of Software Engineering (1968)

The term software engineering was first introduced at the NATO Software Engineering Conference in 1968.
The conference addressed the "software crisis," where software projects were becoming increasingly complex, leading to frequent failures, budget overruns, and delays.
This milestone emphasized the need for structured methodologies, disciplined development practices, and engineering principles in software development.
The Rise of Object-Oriented Programming (1970s-1980s)

The introduction of object-oriented programming (OOP), pioneered by languages like Smalltalk (1972) and later C++ (1983), revolutionized software design.
OOP introduced concepts such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism, making software more modular, reusable, and maintainable.
This milestone marked a shift from procedural programming to a more structured, scalable, and efficient way of developing software.
The Emergence of Agile Methodologies (2001-Present)

In 2001, the Agile Manifesto was introduced, advocating for iterative development, collaboration, and customer feedback-driven approaches.
Agile methodologies, such as Scrum and Kanban, replaced rigid, document-heavy processes like Waterfall, allowing teams to adapt to changing requirements more effectively.
This milestone has shaped modern software development, emphasizing continuous integration, DevOps, and rapid deployment models.
These milestones have played a crucial role in shaping the evolution of software engineering, improving software quality, efficiency, and adaptability to technological advancements.)

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

(The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a structured process that guides the development of software applications, ensuring efficiency, quality, and reliability. The main phases of SDLC include:

Planning

Involves defining the project scope, objectives, and feasibility.
Stakeholders determine resources, timeline, budget, and risks.
Helps in setting a roadmap for the entire development process.
Requirements Analysis

Identifies and documents functional and non-functional requirements.
Involves discussions with stakeholders, end-users, and business analysts.
Results in a Software Requirement Specification (SRS) document.
Design

Architects and designers create software models, system architecture, and database structures.
UI/UX design, security considerations, and data flow diagrams are developed.
Ensures the system structure is well-defined before coding begins.
Implementation (Coding)

Developers write the actual source code based on design specifications.
Uses programming languages and development frameworks.
Version control and best coding practices are followed.
Testing

Software is tested for bugs, performance issues, and security vulnerabilities.
Various testing techniques like unit testing, integration testing, and user acceptance testing (UAT) are applied.
Ensures the software meets requirements and functions correctly.
Deployment

The software is released to the production environment or end-users.
Can involve staged rollouts or immediate full releases.
Cloud-based applications may be deployed using CI/CD pipelines.
